Problem Set 1 for course Native App Studio on UvA

This app contains Mr. Potatohead.
At first a blank potato is portrayed. On clicking checkboxes, body parts will get added accordingly.
On deselecting checkboxes, body parts will be removed.

This app was tested on a Nexes 5X device on Android 7.0 (API 24) and an emulator running Nexus One (API 24). 
It is assumed to work on lower API's as well.
